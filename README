Sorry it took me so long to get back. All in all, this is really useful and awesome to use. The only things I'd love are:

1/Functional ad units. It definitely worked for me on one site, but not on most. 
2/Less pop-ups. I noticed that even when you hit OK or Cancel the pop-up for rAd replace still pops up over and over. It would be  great if we fixed this. 

Thanks again for this...this tool is SO helpful to us!
